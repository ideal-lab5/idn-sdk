# IDN SDK Kitchensink Runtime

The IDN SDK Kitchensink Runtime is a comprehensive testing and benchmarking environment for the Ideal Networks (IDN) SDK. It includes a fully-configured Substrate runtime that integrates all IDN pallets with standard Substrate functionality, allowing developers to:

 - Manually test IDN functionality in a realistic blockchain environment
 - Run benchmarks to measure performance and resource usage
 - Verify interactions between IDN pallets and other Substrate components
- Prototype new features in a complete runtime context

See the [main Kitchensink README](../README.md) to learn how to spin up a network with the Kitchensink runtime.
Also learn how to run the [benchmarks](../benchmarking/README.md) against this runtime.

# IDN SDK Kitchensink Node

The IDN SDK Kitchensink Node is a testing environment for the Ideal Networks (IDN) SDK. It includes a fully-configured Substrate node that integrates with the [IDN SDK Kitchensink Runtime](../runtime/README.md), allowing developers to:

 - Manually test IDN functionality in a realistic blockchain environment
 - Verify interactions between runtime and node, as well as external components
 - Prototype new features in a complete node context

See the [main Kitchensink README](../README.md) to learn how to spin up a network with the Kitchensink runtime.
